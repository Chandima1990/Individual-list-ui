# InSharp Assessment - Chandima Ekanayake

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Development server

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Room for improvements

## As I am submitting the assessment somewhat two days early, I see some things can be still improved in the application with some work here and there.

* Forms can be protected with some canDeactivate and FormGuards so the unsaved data would not be missing.
* Detail pages can be redirected through a router resolver so the data would be gauranteed to be loaded when the user navigated to the page. 
* Can use language files to get labels, messages and other display texts.
* Can use a general config file to store hot swappable values so application behaviour can be changed without a deployment. 
* Unit tests can be written.
